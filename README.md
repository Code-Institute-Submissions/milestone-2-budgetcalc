# Interactive Front End Development: BudgetCalc

This is a web app created for the 2nd Milestone Project for [Code Insitute course: Full Stack Developement](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/).

This web app will make use of technologies covered in the course up to this point inlcuding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to demonstrate an understanding of these technologies.

This web app aims to solve a real-world problem.

## UX (User Experience)
The creator of this web app, Alexander Forrest, currently uses a spreadsheet for budget calculations, however during his JavaScript course modules at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) he came to understand the power of JavaScript and it's ability to create an interactive way to deal with budgeting.

There are other solutions and apps currently on the market but they are either not robust enough or too complicated for Alexander's needs. After asking friends and family he realised that many other people are also dealing with the same issues and looking for a solution.

Here is an overview of different types of potential users and what they may want to achieve with BudgetCalc:

### User Stories
- #### As a first time visitor:
    1. I want to have a clear understanding about how to use BudgetCalc.
    2. I want to intuitively be able to move around the site through clear path finding.
    3. I want to be able to export information from the web app.

- #### A a returning visitor:
    1. I want to have the data from previous sessions available so I can add to or change elements to recalculate my budget.
    2. I want to see new features introduced.
    3. I want to be able to suggest improvements or report bugs.

- #### As a potential employer looking for a software developer:
    1. I would like to get a sense of Alexander's ability as a Interactive Front End Developer.
    2. I want to see that Alexander understands the technologies he's working with.

- #### As a fellow Code Institute student:
    1. I want to see the work of my classmate to gain inspiration and ideas for my own projects.

- #### As the site owner:
    1. I want to create a web app that I can be proud off.
    2. I want to minimalise or elimate bugs to provide a seemless experience to users.
    3. I want to impress potential employers with my work.




If Alexander was having trouble with these things a home-made repsonsive web app seemed like the best solution.


has built out the basic structure for the milestone project but plans to continue developing the project as he comes up with new features


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.



The goal of this project to to allow users to calculate their net worth and monthly budgets. The net worth calculation will take into account current accounts and current debts. The monthly budgets will take into account income, fixed costs and variable costs as too aid in financial planning.
 




## Methodolgy

As a user of his own web app, BudgetCalc, Alexander will easily be able to put himself in the shoes of potential user and can use this benefit to develop useful features. He also has a background in video production which gives him a unique perspective when trying to look at a problem from multiple viewpoints as video production is often for an audience with a wide range of tastes.

This methodology of this project will be based on three core principals during development;

- #### That [Form follows function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function#Software_engineering).
    1. The form of the web app should follow it's goals and core functionality.
    2. Represent first and foremost the engineering requirements during construction.
    3. If the architecture dictates how the software should work it's likely to suffer from inflexibitly and adaptation to change and new ideas during the developement process.

- #### The principle of always delivering a [Potentially Shippable Product](https://less.works/less/framework/potentially-shippable-product-increment)
    1. This means that the product is always working after a sprint (coding session), albiet in a basic form.
    2. The product could potentially be submitted at any time.
    3. Working elements in the project allow more room for evaluation.
    4. Working elements also allow more room for evolution as new ideas are added.

- #### Working with a [Product Backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog)
    1. As software developement is an ongoing process a product backlog allows for the prioritisating of information.
    2. A product backlog provides a roadmap for future development.
    3. Iteams completeded on the product backlog will not be removed by moved to a done section as to see progress through the elements.

## Process
When taking the methodology into account the following process has been created:
- #### Planning
    1. Brainstorming about core elements to make the web app work.
    2. Brainstorming about stretch goals and the future of the web app.
    3. Contact with the Code Institute appointed mentor for guidance and real world experience when tackelling some of the different challenges.
    4. Discussing the project with friends and family to get input.
    5. Drawing out the structure on paper and creating wireframes to server as a guideline for repsonsive development.

- #### Creating basic functionality (focus on JavaScript)
    1. For this project it made sense to first start with some basic functionality, as BudgetCalc essentially is a complicated calculator with many moving parts, getting those parts to work together is essential before moving on to the final design.
    2. Showing working calculations makes all following brainstorming sessions and mentor contact moments more effecient as the product is starting to develope funcationality.
    3. This creates boundaries for design, and gives a clearer vision about what is possible and what isn't.

- #### Creating basic user interface and structure (focus on HTML/CSS)
    1. At this point it's important to start selecting a color pallete and injecting imagery as this will assist with planning and building out the funcationality of the product.
    2. Understanding how a user will interact with the product may trigger new ideas to create a better user experience.

- #### Evaluation
    1. More brainstorming about potential user interactivity elements.
    2. More brainstorming about potential feature and functions, such as incorporating new potential API elements that benefit the product.
    3. Discussion with the Code Institute appointed mentor to see what areas need improvement.

- #### Creating advanced functionality simultaneously to user interactity (focus on JavaScript/HTML/CSS)
    1. During this final step it's important to have a prioritised overview as to first focus on elements that either are quick-wins or have the greatest impact.
    2. Working on both functionality and user interactivity interchangably allows for both to grow together into a product that is both useful and enjoyable to use.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

### Existing Features
- #### Net worth calulcation: This provides an overview of the current state of someones net worth. This can be a great indicator of financial health in the long-run.
- #### Income calculation: There are many different types of income, these have all been accounted for: salary, bonuses, gig jobs.
- #### Fixed costs calculation: In order to know how much budget remains for spending first all the fixed costs need to be calculated to understand what remains for the variables costs.
- #### Variable costs calculation: These are things that are not recurring or changing month-to-month. Items that fall into this category could be food and drink, socialising, and purchasing new things.
- #### Intuitive navigation: User's expect a good product to have easy navigation. It was important to not only give people the means for moving forwards and backwards through the project, but also to give them the ability to jump around and have a clear understanding about how far along and where they are in the web app.
- #### Export of data: Just filling the data into the app is not sufficient, if a user wants to keep or send the data to someone else then it's important to have a method for exporting the data. Email with use of EmailJS was the fastest and most efficient way to effictively export the data.
- #### Savings and loading data: To ensure that users return to the app and don't use it as a once-off experience it's important to save any progress that the user has made. By offering users a method for saving and retrieving data users are then able to come back to the product and edit any information they've filled in.

### Features Left To implement
- #### Refactoring: Part of the code used can be cleaned up and refactored into shorter code that has the same outcome as code that is currently being used.
- #### Add global support: mMltiple currencies and languages.
- #### Create a settings button and/or questions: Allow users to turn on and off elements in the calculator that do or don't relate to them.
- #### Save data on a central server: Allow users to use the product from different terminals.
- #### Budget recommendations for users: Give users more tips and tricks to improve their budgeting, such as percentages of their bugets they should idealistically be spending on different costs.
- #### Multi-month budgeting: Extrapolate data into a yearly overview so that users can track their spendings over a longer period of time and also having more infromation on budget forecats into the future.
- #### Household budgeting: Provide budgeting info for multi-person households, such as which costs are shared and which are individual to the user.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
